0.31
 - Improved coverage of 'random' functions.
0.30
 - Add Rmpf_snprintf and Rmpf_snprintf_ret.
 - Fix test 18 in test1.t. (It *was* checking the first 96 bits of two
   64-bit numbers for equality ... which seems a bit dubious, and not
   always guaranteed to succeed.)
0.29
 - 2 missing ';' in the XS file (subs ___GMP_CC and ___GMP_CFLAGS) meant
   that version 0.28 wouldn't build with some compilers. Now fixed.
 - If there's no variable to be formatted, Rmpf_(f/s)printf no longer
   need to be supplied with a dummy variable.
 - Some buggy tests in printf.t hopefully fixed.

0.28
 Requires gmp-4.2.0 or later
 In response to bug http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46499:
 - Amendment to Makefile.PL wrt 'long long' and 'long double' support.
 - Remove reliance on $Config{use64bitint} in t/new.t and t/out_str.t
 - Add some MAC OS X notes to README and fix some typos.
 
 In response to bug http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46603
 - In Rmpf_get_d_2exp, change data type of 'exp' from unsigned to signed,
   and return exp as an IV not a UV.

 In response to bug http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46604
 - Fix ___GMP__CC() and ___GMP_CFLAGS() so that they return undef
   if __GMP_CC and __GMP_CFLAGS are not defined by the gmp library.

 Thanks, Bob Kuo and Jonathan Leto.

0.27
 - Requires gmp-4.2.3 or later.
 - Remove (the need for) INLINE.h.
 - Change Rmpf_sprintf to return the number of characters written.
 - Add __GNU_MP_VERSION, __GNU_MP_VERSION_MINOR, __GNU_MP_VERSION_PATCHLEVEL,
   __GMP_CC and __GMP_CFLAGS
 - Fix overload_copy sub so that the copy preserves the precision of the original.
 - Change Rmpf_printf() so that, like its fprintf and sprintf counterparts,
   it formats only one variable at a time.

0.26
 - Add Rmpf_fprintf, Rmpf_sprintf and Rmpf_sprintf_ret
 - Finally fix (hopefully) the bug in the test1.t test script (that was
   supposed to be fixed by the release of 0.25).

0.25
 - Fix bug in test1.t tests script that resulted in a reported
   'make test' failure on many platforms.

0.24
 - Add TRmpf_out_str and TRmpf_inp_str.
 - Rmpf_out_str now also takes an optional prefix argument.
 - Remove the tests in the Makefile.PL that test for the presence of
   a suitable compiler and GMP library.
 - Minor bugfix to Rmpf_out_str. (Zero was being returned as '0.' and
   therefore boolean "true".)

0.15
 - Fix bug in test suite. (Test 12 in test1.t improperly constructed.)
 - Rewrite new().
 - Rmpf_out_str() now takes an optional fourth argument - a string 
   that will be appended to the mpf_out_str() output. Also stdout is
   fflush()'d each time Rmpf_out_str() is called.
 - The overload functions and new() can now handle a long double value
   correctly
 - Rewrite Rmpf_get_str to start with a leading zero, and to use 'e'
   instead of '@' (for bases <= 10).

0.14
 - First CPAN release
 - No longer assign Exporter and DynaLoader to @Math::GMPf::ISA.
 - Fix bug in tests 35, 26 and 37 in overload.t
 - Add support for perls built with -Duse64bitint.
 - add new() function/method to facilitate initialization/assignment
