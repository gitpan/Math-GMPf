0.27
 - Remove (the need for) INLINE.h.
 - Change Rmpf_sprintf to return the number of characters written.
 - Add __GNU_MP_VERSION, __GNU_MP_VERSION_MINOR, __GNU_MP_VERSION_PATCHLEVEL,
   __GMP_CC and __GMP_CFLAGS
 - Fix overload_copy sub so that the copy preserves the precision of the original.
 - Change Rmpf_printf() so that, like its fprintf and sprintf counterparts,
   it formats only one variable at a time.

0.26
 - Add Rmpf_fprintf, Rmpf_sprintf and Rmpf_sprintf_ret
 - Finally fix (hopefully) the bug in the test1.t test script (that was
   supposed to be fixed by the release of 0.25).

0.25
 - Fix bug in test1.t tests script that resulted in a reported
   'make test' failure on many platforms.

0.24
 - Add TRmpf_out_str and TRmpf_inp_str.
 - Rmpf_out_str now also takes an optional prefix argument.
 - Remove the tests in the Makefile.PL that test for the presence of
   a suitable compiler and GMP library.
 - Minor bugfix to Rmpf_out_str. (Zero was being returned as '0.' and
   therefore boolean "true".)

0.15
 - Fix bug in test suite. (Test 12 in test1.t improperly constructed.)
 - Rewrite new().
 - Rmpf_out_str() now takes an optional fourth argument - a string 
   that will be appended to the mpf_out_str() output. Also stdout is
   fflush()'d each time Rmpf_out_str() is called.
 - The overload functions and new() can now handle a long double value
   correctly
 - Rewrite Rmpf_get_str to start with a leading zero, and to use 'e'
   instead of '@' (for bases <= 10).

0.14
 - First CPAN release
 - No longer assign Exporter and DynaLoader to @Math::GMPf::ISA.
 - Fix bug in tests 35, 26 and 37 in overload.t
 - Add support for perls built with -Duse64bitint.
 - add new() function/method to facilitate initialization/assignment
